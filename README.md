## Gameplay

This is a classic snake game.
You move the snake around the board with the keyboard arrow keys.
If the snake's head bumps into its own body, the game ends.

The target is generated at a random position on the board. The goal is to catch this target.
Every time the target is caught, the snake gets bigger.

You can move the snake in every direction, but not the direct opposite of the current movement direction (not direct left if the snake is moving right).
